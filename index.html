                        <p>Additionally, during Poway Unified School District breaks we plan a high adventure outing to include canoeing the Colorado River, hiking the Grand canyon, or backpacking on Catalina Island.</p>

                        <p>
                            The Troop was first charted in September of 1969. Burl Howard, Howard Larson and George Braun felt that Rancho Bernardo was growing large enough to support a Troop of its own. Burl became the first Scoutmaster, Howard became the awards chairman and George became the committee chairperson.
                        </p>
                        <p>  
                            “The concept was to be an outdoor troop with lots of hiking and exploring. Highlights of the Scout year were to be training for weeklong treks, water safety preparation and anything else that we could think of that would be fun for the Scouts and could include the fathers.” The original charter members were Greg and Mike Braun, John and Mike Colgan, Paul Larson, Mark Howard, William Tillerson, David Tillerson and Steve Telian. This membership rapidly grew with a large number of transfers and new members.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Troop was originally sponsored by the Rotary Club of Rancho Bernardo. It is now sponsored by the Rancho Bernardo Community Church. We have met in a number of locations as we grew, including Hope Methodist Church, The Rancho Bernardo Swim and Tennis Club and now at the Rancho Bernardo Community Church.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the early history of the Troop, Mr. Braun helped to establish the co-ed Explorer Post 2680. This group provided an opportunity for older Scouts and teenage girls to participate in High Adventure activities, in which it is reported that the girls were quite able to “hold their own.” Mr. Braun was transferred to Colorado and the Post was deactivated with his transfer and the aging out of most of the Scouts. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A co-ed Venture Crew 680 was established providing an opportunity for older boys and girls to participate in many high adventure activities such as Philmont,  Boundary Waters, Sierra Treks and many Troop outings. Bud Fosdick, Dorothy Long, Chris Barr and Barbara Weeks were Crew Advisors during this time period before the Crew was deactivated in 2009.

                            <h3>Troop 680 Mission Statement</h3>
                            <p >Troop 680 emphasizes Fun, Leadership, and Teamwork. We have Fun at great outings. We generally have two per month and they range from advanced backpacks such as "The Sierra Trek", to day hikes, bike rides, canoe trips, and backpacking in the local mountains or desert. We emphasize Leadership through intensive training followed by broad responsibility. Our ideal is to have Scouts manage all Troop functions autonomously. The adult leadership is the coaching staff, offering guidance, encouragement, and security. Teamwork is developed through competitive team building and as a necessary adjunct to encouraging all ability and age ranges on most of our high adventure outings.</p>
